### Project Highlights
  * Analyzed the pros and cons of application for each model.
  * Used suitable performance metrics to evaluate different models.
  * Justified which model would be the best by comparing performance and computational cost.
  
### General Descriptions
  * Constructed an intervention system that analyzes the dataset on students' performance.
  * Leveraged supervised learning techniques to predicts the likelihood that a given student will pass.
